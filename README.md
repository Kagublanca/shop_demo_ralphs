 # Ralphs

This is a mock ecommerce store called Ralphs! (Ralph is my sisters dog. He is a huuuuuge St Bernard and likes food. So it was only natural to use him as the mascot of the project. You will be able to see an increadibly professional photoshop job done for the logo of the store, which has him included!)

### What is it?

This is a little project I made in just a few days, so that I could showcase both my frontend, and backend skills. There is still a lot of work to be done on this project, but its incredible the amount of ideas and improvements I keep thinking I could make.

------------



### How to use

Currently the project only has very limited functionality. You can search for a project using the "Search" input box, which will take you to the product page. From here you will be able to click on a product - leading you to its dynamic route. 

------------



### Known Bugs

At present, the searchbox can act strange if you type a two worded item. The only item currently able to do this is "mallet hammer". On next on to-do list. 

------------



### What next?

Improve CSS for the "Search" route and for the dynamic pages.

Add UPDATE and DELETE functionality for the backend.

Add a basket, where you will be able to "checkout". (Please don't think I actually have 123098 apples in stock please).

Authentication and frontend routes in order to add products, and do pretty much all CRUD operations. (To mock up staff/admin functionality)
